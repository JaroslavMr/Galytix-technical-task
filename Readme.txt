1. Download the pretrained set of Word2Vec vectors from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM
   and save them to the same working folder
2. Run pip install -e .
3. Run python main.py
4. Code is structured into modules but only task c) will show results in Terminal. Results of taks a) and b) can be seen in main.py when using interactive window.

technical_task.py already at git is not needed to run this.
